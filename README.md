# ProjectApollo11

ProjectApollo11 is a web application that allows you to post lost items the you found. The application will automatically tag the image and post it so other users who may have lost that item can find it. Then, they can message the person who has their lost item. So other features include location, custom search with spell check, etc...

Here is our logo inspired by space!!
